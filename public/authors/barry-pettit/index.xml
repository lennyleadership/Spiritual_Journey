      <description>&lt;p&gt;The original Greek word for Christian is “Christianos” which comes from the two Greek words “Christ and tian.” The word Christ means “anointed” and tian means “little.” So the word “Christian” literally means “little anointed ones.” During his life Jesus was called the “messiah” which meant “the anointed one” and we are his “little anointed ones” who have been anointed by his Holy Spirit to represent Him in this world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are a true follower of Christ. If you’ve given your life to Jesus. If you’ve been washed in the blood of the lamb. That means that you are now one part of the body of Christ! You are part of something greater than yourself! You are a part of the eternal family of God! That means blessing, that means help, that means accountability, and that means responsibility!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
