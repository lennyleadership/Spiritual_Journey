      <description>People seem to forget that all Christ’s sufferings on the cross were foreordained. People seem to forget that all Christ’s sufferings on the cross were only necessary for man’s salvation. People seem to forget that all Christ’s sufferings were endured voluntarily and of His own free will.
When I think of all this, I see nothing painful or disagreeable in the subject of Christ’s cross. On the contrary, I see wisdom and power, peace and hope, joy and gladness, comfort and consolation.</description>
