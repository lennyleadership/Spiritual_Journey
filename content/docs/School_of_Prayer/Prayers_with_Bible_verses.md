## Worship God
[used for an opening prayer]  

‪(Psalms‬90:16 NKJV) Let Your work appear to Your servants, And Your glory to their children.

**My prayer**: May your work appear to us, may your glory appear to us.

(Micah‬7:18-20 NKJ)V

18 Who is a God like You,  
Pardoning iniquity  
And passing over the transgression of the remnant of His heritage?  
He does not retain His anger forever,  
Because He delights in mercy.  
19 He will again have compassion on us,  
And will subdue our iniquities.  
You will cast all our sins  
Into the depths of the sea.  
20 You will give truth to Jacob  
And mercy to Abraham,   
Which You have sworn to our fathers  
From days of old.  

## Walk in the way of goodness
智慧必使你行善人的道，守义人的路。(箴言2:20 和合本)  
So you may walk in the way of goodness, And keep to the paths of righteousness.(Proverbs2:20 NKJV)  

**My prayer**: Pray that God help me walk in the way of goodness, keep me to the paths of righteousness.

## Ask God to bless our work
愿主－我们　神的荣美归于我们身上。愿你坚立我们手所做的工；我们手所做的工，愿你坚立。(诗篇90:17 和合本)  
And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us, And establish the work of our hands for us; Yes, establish the work of our hands.(Psalms90:17 NKJV)  

**My prayer**:  Pray that Your beauty lives in us (may Your beauty lives in us),  pray that you establish our work for us.  

## Pray for a person who is in sick
你们要休息，要知道我是　神！我必在外邦中被尊崇，在遍地上也被尊崇。(诗篇 46:10 和合本)   
Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth!(Psalms 46:10 NKJV)   

**My prayer**: Ask God to give XXX a good sleep/rest, like a little child lieing still in God's arms, and knowing that you are God.  He will sustain you and bring you through.  

It is so when we are tempted to faint under affliction. God’s message to us is not, “Be strong and of good courage,” for He knows our strength and courage have fled away. But it is that sweet word, “Be still, and know that I am God.”   

Hudson Taylor was so feeble in the closing months of his life that he wrote a dear friend: “I am so weak I cannot write; I cannot read my Bible; I cannot even pray. I can only lie still in God’s arms like a little child, and trust.”  

And that is all God asks of you, His dear child, when you grow faint in the fierce fires of affliction. Do not try to be strong. Just be still and know that He is God, and will sustain you, and bring you through.

Cowman, L. B. E.. Contemporary Classic/Streams in the Desert (p. 148). Zondervan. Kindle Edition.   

当你灵性软弱要昏倒的时候，也该如此。神给我们的信息不是『你当刚强壮胆』，因为祂知道我们已经筋疲力尽，奋兴不起来了，祂知道我们的力量和胆量已经消失了。祂给我们的信息乃是『你要休息，要知道我是神。』

戴德生（Hudson Taylor）先生在临终几个月，身灵软弱到极点，他给他知己朋友的信中说：『我极其软弱，我不能写信，我不能读经，甚至不能祷告。我只能像一个小孩子一样躺在神的怀中安静、休息、信靠。』

神要你也如此，当你在痛苦的烈火中丧胆的时候，不必自己设法，只要休息，知道祂是神，祂必支持你，带你过去。
