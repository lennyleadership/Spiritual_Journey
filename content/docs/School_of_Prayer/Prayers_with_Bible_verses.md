## Worship God
[used for an opening prayer]  
‪(Psalms‬90:16 NKJV) Let Your work appear to Your servants, And Your glory to their children.

**My prayer**: May your work appear to us, may your glory appear to us.

## Walk in the way of goodness
智慧必使你行善人的道，守义人的路。(箴言2:20 和合本)  
So you may walk in the way of goodness, And keep to the paths of righteousness.(Proverbs2:20 NKJV)  

**My prayer**: Pray that God help me walk in the way of goodness, keep me to the paths of righteousness.

## Ask God to bless our work
愿主－我们　神的荣美归于我们身上。愿你坚立我们手所做的工；我们手所做的工，愿你坚立。(诗篇90:17 和合本)  
And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us, And establish the work of our hands for us; Yes, establish the work of our hands.(Psalms90:17 NKJV)  

**My prayer**:  Pray that Your beauty lives in us (may Your beauty lives in us),  pray that you establish our work for us.
