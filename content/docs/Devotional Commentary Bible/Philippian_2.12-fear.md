‪Philippians‬2:12 NKJV
12 Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear^[1] and trembling;
[1] 我们因你的怒气而消灭，因你的忿怒而惊惶。(诗篇90:7 和合本)
For we have been consumed by Your anger, And by Your wrath we are terrified.(Psalms90:7 NKJV)
