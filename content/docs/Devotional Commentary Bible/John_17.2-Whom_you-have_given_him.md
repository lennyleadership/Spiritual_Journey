(Joh 17:1 KJV)  These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; <mark>glorify thy Son</mark>, that thy Son also may glorify thee:  
(Joh 17:2 KJV)  As thou hast given <mark>him</mark> power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given <mark>him</mark>.  
(Joh 17:3 KJV)  And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.  
(Joh 17:4 KJV)  I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.  
(Joh 17:5 KJV)  And now, O Father, <mark>glorify thou me</mark> with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.  


(Joh 17:2 KJV)  As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to <mark>as many as thou hast given him</mark>.

(Joh 17:2 ESV)  since you have given him authority over all flesh, to give eternal life to <mark>all</mark> whom you have given him.

Question #1: Why use him, instead of me.  

Question #2: Who are they "as many as thou hast given him"?  I tend to believe it would refer to believers.  

Answer: Kevin Yip confirmed my thought.  Good morning Lenny. Yes, I believe that the verse refers to believers. I believe this is what it means. V.3 tells how to have eternal life. That is to know The One True God and Jesus Christ whom God the Father has sent. So all whom are reconciled are reconciled to God the Father. Jn 14:6- “No one comes to the Father but by me.” When we are brought back by the Son, we are brought back to God the Father. In return the Father honours/ glorifies the Son by “giving” them to God the Son.  

…I know all this is very technical but this is the best that I can explain it.

Jesus asked Father to glorify himself in Joh 17:1, 17:5.

Jesus was a man.
