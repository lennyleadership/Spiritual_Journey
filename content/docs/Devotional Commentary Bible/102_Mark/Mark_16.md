马可福音
<!--more-->

16:1 过了安息日、抹大拉的马利亚、和雅各的母亲马利亚、并撒罗米、买了香膏、要去膏耶稣的身体。  
16:2 七日的第一日清早、出太阳的时候、他们来到坟墓那里。  
16:3 彼此说、谁给我们把石头从墓门滚开呢。  
16:4 那石头原来很大、他们抬头一看、却见石头已经滚开了。  
16:5 他们进了坟墓、看见一个少年人坐在右边、穿着白袍。就甚惊恐。  

16:6 那少年人对他们说、不要惊恐。你们寻找那钉十字架的拿撒勒人耶稣。他已经复活了、不在这里。请看安放他的地方。  
16:7 你们可以去告诉他的门徒和彼得说、他在你们以先往加利利去。在那里你们要见他、正如他从前所告诉你们的。  
16:8 他们就出来、从坟墓那里逃跑。又发抖、又惊奇、甚么也不告诉人。因为他们害怕。  
16:9 在七日的第一日清早、耶稣复活了、就先向抹大拉的马利亚显现。耶稣从他身上曾赶出七个鬼。  
16:10 他去告诉那向来跟随耶稣的人。那时他们正哀恸哭泣。  

16:11 他们听见耶稣活了、被马利亚看见、却是不信。  
16:12 这事以后、门徒中间有两个人、往乡下去。走路的时候、耶稣变了形像向他们显现、
16:13 他们就去告诉其余的门徒。其余的门徒、也是不信。  
16:14 后来十一个门徒坐席的时候、耶稣向他们显现、责备他们不信、心里刚硬。因为他们不信那些在他复活以后看见他的人。  
16:15 他又对他们说、你们往普天下去、传福音给万民听。〔万民原文作凡受造的〕

16:16 信而受洗的必然得救。不信的必被定罪。  
16:17 信的人必有神迹随着他们。就是奉我的名赶鬼。说新方言。  
16:18 手能拿蛇。若喝了甚么毒物、也必不受害。手按病人、病人就必好了。[^1]  
16:19 主耶稣和他们说完了话、后来被接到天上、坐在　神的右边。  
16:20 门徒出去、到处宣传福音、主和他们同工、用神迹随着、证实所传的道。阿们。  

[^1]: ‪Mark‬16:15-18 NKJV 
15 And He said to them, “**Go** into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.  
16 He who believes and is baptized **will** be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.  
17 And these signs **will** follow those who believe: In My name they **will** cast out demons; they **will** speak with new tongues;  
18 they **will** take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them; they **will** lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.”  
**Believer's Bible** says:  
We believe that these signs were intended primarily for the apostolic age, before the complete Bible was available in written form. Most of these signs are found in the Book of Acts.  
What was the purpose of these miracles? We believe the answer is found in Heb 2:3-4 [^2]. Before the NT was available in completed form, men would ask the apostles and others for proof that the gospel was divine. To confirm the preaching, God bore witness with signs and wonders and various gifts of the Holy Spirit.  
The need for these signs is gone today. We have the complete Bible. If men won't believe that, they wouldn't believe anyway. Mark did not say that the miracles would continue. The words “to the end of the age” are not found here as they are in Mat_28:18-20.  
However, Martin Luther suggested that “the signs here spoken of are to be used according to need. When the need arises, and the Gospel is hard pressed, then we must definitely do these signs, before we allow the Gospel to be maligned and knocked down.”  
[^2]: ‪Hebrews‬2:2-4 NKJV
2 For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just reward,   
3 how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by those who heard Him,  
4 God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders, with various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to His own will?
