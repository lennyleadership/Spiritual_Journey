为爱倾尽

<!--more-->

Lord, start with forgiving others, breaking my life, spill the Jesus' life in me.  

<div class = "quote">
When Mary of Bethany broke the box of precious ointment and poured it on Jesus’ head, .. Jesus commended Mary for her extravagant act of devotion. ... Our Lord is carried beyond Himself with joy when He sees any of us doing what Mary did, not being set on this or that economy, but being abandoned to Him.  

God spilt the life of His Son that the world might be saved; are we prepared to spill out our lives for Him?

It is time now to break the life, ..., and to spill the thing out.

Our Lord is asking who of us will do it for Him?
