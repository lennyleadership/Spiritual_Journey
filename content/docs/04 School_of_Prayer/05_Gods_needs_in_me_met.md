Put God’s Needs First. “Lo, I come to do Thy will, O God” (Hebrews 10:9). A man’s obedience is to what he sees to be a need; Our Lord’s obedience was to the will of His Father. The cry today is — “We must get some work to do; the heathen are dying without God; we must go and tell them of Him.” We have to see first of all that God’s needs in us personally are being met. “Tarry ye until. . . .” The purpose of this College is to get us rightly related to the needs of God. When God’s needs in us have been met, then He will open the way for us to realise His needs elsewhere.
