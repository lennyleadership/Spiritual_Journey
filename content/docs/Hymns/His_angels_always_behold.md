<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
  祂的脸面，祂的天使常看见，
但不认识祂的大爱；
祂的圣徒虽然认识爱无限，
却未看见祂的丰采。
他们不久也要看见祂脸面，
认识祂的荣耀光明；
但马利亚曾看见祂的泪眼，
知道祂心痛的情形。
知道祂心痛的情形。
  </div>
  <div class="column">
  His angels His countenance always behold,  
But never experience His grace;  
His saints, while they know His unlimited love,  
Have never yet looked on His face.  
Yet soon they will rise and His visage behold,  
The sight of His glory will gain;  
But Mary, beholding His tears as He wept,  
Could see His heart’s anguish and pain,  
Could see His heart’s anguish and pain.
