圣灵将上帝的爱浇灌在我们心里。(罗5:5)  
God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit. (Romans 5:5)

这句经文告诉我，我们有了上帝的爱。这是指着新生命的。

约12:20-26 (新标点和合本经文)   
20 那时，上来过节礼拜的人中，有几个希腊人。   
21 他们来见加利利、伯赛大的腓力，求他说：「先生，我们愿意见耶稣。」   
22 腓力去告诉安得烈，安得烈同腓力去告诉耶稣。   
23 耶稣说：「人子得荣耀的时候到了。   
24 我实实在在地告诉你们，一粒麦子不落在地里死了，仍旧是一粒，若是死了，就结出许多子粒来。    
25 爱惜自己生命的，就失丧生命；在这世上恨恶自己生命的，就要保守生命到永生。    
26 若有人服事我，就当跟从我；我在哪里，服事我的人也要在那里；若有人服事我，我父必尊重他。」   

耶稣是在伯大尼受膏，光荣地进耶路撒冷后说上面这番话的。   

John 12:20-26 (ESV)  
20 Now among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks.  
21 So these came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.”  
22 Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.  
23 And Jesus answered them, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.  
24 Truly, truly, I say to you, unless **a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit**.  
25 Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.  
26 If anyone serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there will my servant be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.
