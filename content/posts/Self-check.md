## 经文  
我说那承受产业的，虽然是全业的**主人**，但为孩童的时候却与奴仆毫无分别，(加4:1)  
I mean that the heir, as long as he is **a child**, is no different from a slave, though he is the **owner** of everything, (Galatians 4:1 ESV)

## Meditation  
Am I growing in spiritual life? or I am stalled?  Do I know that I am the owner of everything?  Do I trust in God?
