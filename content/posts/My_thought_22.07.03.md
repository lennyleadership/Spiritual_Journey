It is Sunday morning.

I don't see the future, but I know I am in God's hand.  He led me through the past four years, and landed me at LifeLabs.  He will land me to another job.

As the devotional Ryder sent yesterday, "Discipline your thoughts to trust Me as I work My ways in your life. Pray about everything; then leave outcomes up to Me. Do not fear My will, for through it I accomplish what is best for you".
