## Jesus in the book of Ezekiel – OUR RIGHTEOUS JUDGE


The prophet Ezekiel lived hundreds of years before Yeshua Jesus was born. He and his people were exiles, captives of Babylon. He was a prophet during hard times and he prophesied of more hard times for the nation of Israel. He predicted the DIASPORA –  

>I will disperse you among the nations and scatter you through the countries… Ezekiel 22:15  

As an authentic prophet of Yahweh God, Ezekiel had a vision. Indeed, he was not only able to predict the diaspora, but he predicted the time when it would be ended, the time when Israel would be regathered to the land, to await the return of the King. He was able to see FAR into the future, into OUR future, when Christ returns to Reign on this earth!  

Ezekiel encounters the Lord Jesus in the very first chapter:  
> <mark>“high above on a throne was a figure like that of a man… glowing… as if full of fire… and brilliant light surrounded him.” – Ezekiel 1:26-27</mark>  

This is not the “suffering servant“ Jesus that is portrayed by Isaiah. This is not the Jesus we read of in the Gospels. This is the Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, when He returns in all His Glory!  
Ezekiel’s vision is remarkably similar to another vision in the Bible, the vision that God gave the Apostle John, while a prisoner on Patmos. There are in fact **OVER EIGHTY PARALLELS** between the prophecy of Ezekiel and the prophecy of John in Revelation. For example, in his vision, John identifies the Lord Jesus as the: 
>“Alpha and Omega, now reigning in heaven” – Revelation 1:5-8  
> “… I turned and saw … someone like a son of man… his eyes were like blazing fire … his face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.” – Revelation 1:13-17  
> “…there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it… from the throne came flashes of lightening, rumblings and peals of thunder…”- Revelation 4:2-5

Like John, Ezekiel finds it difficult to describe what he has seen. He speaks of “the figure like that of a man” who had:
> <mark>“the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord” – Ezekiel 1:28 </mark> 

<mark>The ”glory of the Lord”, here clearly refers to the presence of God revealed in a person</mark>. A person, who, in the fullness of time, 
>“became flesh, and dwelt amongst us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father” -John 1:14

The apostle Paul also describes this person in Philippians 2:
>“Who being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness, and being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself even to death on the cross” – Philippians 2:6-8

Jesus in Ezekiel is revealed as God who became man. Friend, do you know Him? Do you recognize Him? Hundreds and thousands of years before He was born, The prophets recognized Him. Abraham knew Him.  

My friend, the final hour is near. Time is short. Jesus is coming…in flashes of lightning and peals of thunder! The nations of the earth will come against Him. And, the Bible says, **EVERY knee shall bow and EVERY tongue confess that HE IS LORD**. Run to Him now, before it is too late.
