Daisy said on Oct. 27 (Thursday) that the site head said highly regard Jeff Hayter.  Whiteshell did survey on managers' performance recently, and Jeff got the highest score.  Jeff said on Oct. 30 (Sunday) that he will be away for a three-week training of leadership.  He called it a 'brain-washed' training.  

To better understand whether he manages the group under God's leading, I would like to find out how Jeff react to the fact, whether Jeff would become pride, or such opportunity turn to be temptation.  

I am interested in: would be Jeff authentic inside out? why is he popular at work in the group?
