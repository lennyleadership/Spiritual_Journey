But now, O Lord, you are our Father;   
we are the clay, and you are our potter;   
we are all the work of your hand.  
&#8208; Isiah 64:8   

Some of us concern that we pursue our dreams and wander far away from God's will for us.  This verse reminds me that as long as we connect with Him, even a loss connection, He is still working on us.  He will pull us back on His way.  The restoration process would take long time, maybe our life time, maybe is painful, however He will finish His work.
