- The Cross of Jesus
title: wisdom and power, peace and hope, joy and gladness, comfort and consolation of the Cross
toc: true

People seem to forget that all Christ’s sufferings on the cross were foreordained.
People seem to forget that all Christ’s sufferings on the cross were only necessary for man’s salvation.
People seem to forget that all Christ’s sufferings were endured voluntarily and of His own free will.

When I think of all this, I see nothing painful or disagreeable in the subject of Christ’s cross. On the contrary, I see wisdom and power, peace and hope, joy and gladness, comfort and consolation. The more I keep the cross in my mind’s eye, the more fullness I seem to discern in it. The longer I dwell on the cross in my thoughts, the more I am satisfied that there is more to be learned at the foot of the cross than anywhere else in the world.
